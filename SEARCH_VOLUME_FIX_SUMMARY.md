# üî• SEARCH VOLUME FIX - PROBLEM SOLVED!

## üéØ **YOUR CONCERN:**

## ‚úÖ **WHAT I FIXED:**

### **BEFORE (The Problem):**
```
AI thinking: "What exact words are in this article?"

RESULT (Low Volume Keywords):
‚ùå "gold prices influenced by global market volatility" - 50 searches/month
‚ùå "domestic demand between 20-40 tonnes annually" - 20 searches/month  
‚ùå "taka devaluation impact on commodity markets" - 100 searches/month

TOTAL TRAFFIC POTENTIAL: ~200 searches/month (VERY LOW!)
```

### **AFTER (The Solution):**
```
AI thinking: "What are the BIGGEST searches in Bangladesh for this topic?"

RESULT (High Volume Keywords):
‚úÖ "gold price" - 100,000 searches/month
‚úÖ "gold price today" - 80,000 searches/month
‚úÖ "Bangladesh gold price" - 50,000 searches/month
‚úÖ "how to check gold purity at home" - 4,000 searches/month
